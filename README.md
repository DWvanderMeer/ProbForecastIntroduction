# Introduction to probabilistic forecasting

This notebook is part 1 of 2 in which my colleague Akylas Stratigakos and I gave a lecture on probabilistic forecasting and optimal trading.

This part, on probabilistic forecasting, aims to:
- Introduce basic concepts of forecasting such as stochastic processes, the types of forecasts and forecast evaluation.
- Introduce feature inspection and feature engineering.
- Apply off-the-shelf forecasting algorithms on publicly available real-world data.

The real-world data come from the [Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014](www.drhongtao.com/gefcom/2014) and contains tracks for wind power, solar power and electricity demand. In this presentation, the focus was on wind power forecasting.
